          My father's side of the family offers a different, yet equally compelling, narrative. His
          ancestors played an important role in the development of the community of Pasco,
          Washington, through their work, dedication, and commitment to education. Their choices
          and sacrifices built the foundation on which our family stands today.
        </p>
        <p>
          After serving as a dentist in the Army, my grandfather Kent moved his young family to
          Pasco to open his own dental practice. He arrived with one child, and the family soon
          grew to seven—six boys and one girl. My father was the third child in this busy,
          energetic household.

    <section class="ancestry-row">

        <p>
          The family settled on three acres of land just outside of town. Days were filled with
          chores and responsibilities, balanced with school, music practice, and outdoor
          adventures. That property gave my father and his siblings room to explore, work hard, and
          use their creativity and imagination.
        </p>
        <p>
          This love for rural living traces back to my great-grandparents, Carroll and Pearl, who
          lived on a dairy farm in Sunnyside, Washington. In 1941, Carroll was hired by the Morning
          Milk Company (later the Carnation Milk Company) to purchase milk contracts from local
          farmers, a job that kept him closely connected to the agricultural world.

      <p>
        As I look at my father's ancestry, I see patterns of hard work, faith, and dedication to
        both family and community. Their stories remind me that the opportunities I enjoy today
        were made possible by generations who were willing to sacrifice, adapt, and serve. Knowing
        their history helps me understand my own responsibilities and inspires me to carry their
        legacy forward.
