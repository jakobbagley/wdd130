        Preserving My Family Legacy
Family history is more than just names and dates on a family tree. It represents the stories, struggles, and triumphs of the people who came before us, shaping who we are today. This website exists to preserve and share the rich heritage of my family, with a specific focus on the ancestral lines that connect me to the past. By documenting these histories now, I want to ensure that future generations will understand their origins and appreciate the sacrifices and achievements of my ancestors. This website provides personal narratives and contextualized information that brings our ancestors to life. This is not about just birth and death dates, but also stories about how my ancestors lived, the challenges they faced, and the values they held dear. 
My story began in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, on May 20th, 1998.  I was born to a loving mother, Donna Jean Montgomery, and William Ryan Bagley.  At the time, my father was at the University of Oklahoma, where he was pursuing his degree in Dentistry.  Two years later, we moved to Richland, Washington, where we established our home and my father’s dental practice.  It was here that I was raised, educated, served my service mission, and where I currently work full-time while pursuing my degree from BYUI.

      <p>
        My mother's family history spans generations of resilience and determination. Her ancestors came from difficult backgrounds, each contributing unique cultural traditions and experiences to our family tapestry. Understanding this lineage helps me appreciate the cultural heritage I've inherited, from holiday traditions to family recipes that have been passed down through generations. Both of my mother's parents came from Appalachia; my mother's father was from Virginia, and my mother's mother was from Kentucky.  Both came from broken homes where abuse and alcoholism shattered the family and resulted in poverty.
They both survived this difficult challenge and met after both moved to Mesa, Arizona.  Here, they met, fell in love, discovered the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and began the family that resulted in my mother, Donna.  As a result of her parents' struggles, educational choices were limited, but it didn’t stop either of them from obtaining training and skills that would help them provide for the family and make the jump to the middle class. Life was a struggle at times, and due to my Grandfather Larry’s occupation as a technician for the telephone company, the family had to move a lot during my mother’s childhood.  They moved a total of 19 times in the first 21 years of Donna’s life. This constant moving influenced my mother's desire to find a home and avoid moving if possible.</p>

      <h3>Page 3: "Father's Ancestry"</h3>
      <p>
       My father's side of the family offers a different, yet equally compelling, narrative. His ancestors contributed to the development of the community of Pasco, Washington, through their work, participation in local institutions, and commitment to education and civic responsibility. Understanding this lineage reveals patterns of occupational choices, educational achievements, and community involvement that have influenced our family's values. This section examines how historical events impacted the family and how family members responded to these challenges.
My Father's family came to Pasco, WA, after his Father, Kent, finished his obligations to the Army, where he served as a dentist.  He came to Pasco to establish his own dental practice.  He arrived with one child, and the family soon grew to seven. Six boys and one girl. My father was the third child of the family.  Grandpa Bagley raised his family on 3 acres outside of town.  Where their days were filled with chores and responsibilities, mixed with an education, practicing musical instruments, and recreation. The property and isolation allowed them to explore and use their creativity and imagination. This desire to raise the family in a rural environment comes from the agricultural background that he came from.  Kent’s parents, Carroll and Pearl, lived on a dairy farm in Sunnyside, Washington about an hour away from Pasco.  They moved there in 1941 after the Morning Milk Company hired Carroll to purchase milk contracts with the local farmers.  The company would later become the Carnation Milk company.
