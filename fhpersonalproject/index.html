      <p>
        Family history is more than just names and dates on a family tree. It represents the
        stories, struggles, and triumphs of the people who came before us, shaping who we are today.
        This website exists to preserve and share the rich heritage of my family, with a specific
        focus on the ancestral lines that connect me to the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        By documenting these histories now, I want to ensure that future generations will
        understand their origins and appreciate the sacrifices and achievements of our ancestors.
        My story began in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, on May 20th, 1998. I was born to a loving
        mother, Donna Jean Montgomery, and William Ryan Bagley. At the time, my father was at the
        University of Oklahoma, pursuing his degree in dentistry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two years later, we moved to Richland, Washington, where we established our home and my
        father’s dental practice. It was here that I was raised, educated, served my service
        mission, and where I currently work full-time while pursuing my degree from BYUI. The
        experiences, places, and people of Richland shaped much of who I am today and continue to
        influence the choices I make and the values I hold dear.
