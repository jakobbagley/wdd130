          My mother's family history spans generations of resilience and determination. Her
          ancestors came from difficult backgrounds, each contributing unique cultural traditions
          and experiences to our family tapestry. Understanding this lineage helps me appreciate
          the cultural heritage I've inherited, from holiday traditions to family recipes that
          have been passed down through the years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both of my mother's parents came from Appalachia; my grandfather was from Virginia and
          my grandmother from Kentucky. They grew up in homes where abuse and alcoholism shattered
          family stability and created deep poverty. Yet in the face of these hardships, both of
          them developed remarkable strength and a desire to build something better for their own
          children.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually, they each made their way to Mesa, Arizona, where they met, fell in love, and
          discovered the gospel of Jesus Christ. That decision changed the direction of our family
          forever, giving them a spiritual foundation and a new sense of hope. From those early
          choices came the home in which my mother, Donna, was raised and the values she later
          passed on to me.

        Because of her parents' struggles, educational opportunities were limited, yet both of them
        sought training and skills that would allow them to provide for the family and move into
        the middle class. My grandfather’s work as a telephone company technician meant frequent
        moves—nineteen moves in the first twenty-one years of my mother's life. Constantly
        packing up and starting over left a deep impression on her and shaped her desire to create
        a stable, lasting home for her own children. Their story reminds me that even in difficult
        circumstances, courage and faith can change the course of a family.
