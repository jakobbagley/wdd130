            Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon River.
            The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people
            living near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love
            with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.
          </p>
          <p>
            Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn
            sheep are also commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring
            ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide
            shelter from sun or rain when needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I–IV. The Salmon is one of the
            longest undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is
            higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in
            the late summer. There are good rapids all summer, but families with children who
            like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.

            Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere,
            the Green River flows towards the mighty Colorado River and the sea. High grey stone
            cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous.
          </p>
          <p>
            This 84-mile trip runs from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River, Utah)
            and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric
            and historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities. Desolation is rated
            a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days.
          </p>
          <p>
            Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark. This designation is based
            on the uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.

            Experience one of the most iconic river trips in the world as you raft the Colorado
            River through the Grand Canyon. Towering cliffs, hidden waterfalls, side canyons, and
            world-class whitewater make this an unforgettable adventure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rapids range from moderate to very challenging depending on water levels. Trips are
            typically multi-day, giving you time to explore side hikes, relax on sandy beaches,
            and soak in the incredible night sky far from city lights.
