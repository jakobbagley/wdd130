    <h2>Jake</h2>
    <p> Hi, my name is Jakob Bagley. I’m the middle child in my family with an older sister, Emily, and a younger brother, Ian. 
        Growing up in Richland, Washington, has been a big part of who I am, and I’ve enjoyed being right in the middle between my siblings. 
        I currently work at Chinook Heating and Air Company in Kennewick, Washington, where I do parts runs and stock the warehouse. 
        It might sound simple, but the job has taught me a lot about being responsible, staying organized, and managing my time well.</p> 
    </p>I’m also a college student working on a degree in Computer Science with a focus on Applied Technology. I’ve always been interested
        in how technology works and how it can solve everyday problems.  I am a senior, and I am excited to start a career in the tech world.</p> 
    </p>Outside of school and work, one of my favorite things to do is travel. I’ve had the chance to spend spring, summer, and winter breaks
        exploring new places around the world. I’ve been lucky enough to visit Europe, South America, and Asia, and each trip has given me new
        experiences and perspectives. Out of all the countries I’ve been to, Japan and South Korea stand out as my favorites. I love the 
        culture, the food, and especially Japanese anime, with Attack on Titan being one of my favorites.</p>
